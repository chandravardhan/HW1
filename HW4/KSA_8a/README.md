## Kogge–Stone adder
The Kogge–Stone adder takes up more space than the Brent–Kung adder to implement, but it has less fan-out at each step, resulting in better performance for conventional CMOS process nodes. However, wiring congestion is a regular problem with Kogge–Stone adders.
The Kogge–Stone adder takes up more space than the Brent–Kung adder to implement, but it has a reduced fan-out at each stage, which improves performance for normal CMOS process nodes. Wiring congestion, on the other hand, is a common issue with Kogge–Stone adders.


### The reason why it was not working was because of one module that i was not ending it.
