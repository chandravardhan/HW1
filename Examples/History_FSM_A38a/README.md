# History FSM (Finite State Machine)

Finite State Machines (FSM) are sequential circuit used in many digital systems to control the behavior of systems and dataflow paths. Examples of FSM include control units and sequencers. This lab introduces the concept of two types of FSMs, Mealy and Moore, and the modeling styles to develop such machines. This example covers the design for a ***finite state machine***

## Python:
This ***historyFSM*** function shows the behavior of the SV code. This function uses multiple global variables to keep track of previous values.

## Python Testbench:

This testbench follows the same procedure explained in the first introduction.
